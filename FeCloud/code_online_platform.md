### CodeSandbox vs CodeBox

#### Editor

* CodeSandbox: `Free File System`; Take the [monaco-editor](https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor);
* CodeBox

#### Social

* CodeSandbox: It supports `a real-time collaboration`. You have `access to some of VS Code settings`.
* CodeBox: CodePen takes social experiences to another level. Likes, `comments, views, tags, posts, collections`, etc.- it all makes CodePen a `social web development platform`. And it can take documentation and a dedicated blog.
