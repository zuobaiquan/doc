Today, I'll diff atime、mtime、ctime and birthtime in Node.js.

* `atime`: or access time, is updated when the file’s contents are read by an application or a command such as `grep` or `cat`.
* `mtime`: or modification time, is when the file was last modified. When you change the contents of a file, its mtime changes.
* `ctime`, or change time, is when the file’s property changes. It will always be changed when the mtime changes, but also when you change the file’s permissions, name or location.
